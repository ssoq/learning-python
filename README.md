## Throughout the repository, you will find:

### [Basic Programs:]("https://github.com/ssoq/learning-python")

These are programmed for me to learn the basics of loops, determaination statements, methods, functions, and such.

<br>

[### Mini Programs:]("https://github.com/ssoq/learning-python/tree/main/programs")

These are programmed for actual input from the users, as if it were a production ready program though, interaction is basic, meaning the code is not all that complex.

<br>

### [Large Programs:](""https://github.com/ssoq/learning-python/tree/main/applications")

These are to act out as actual programs, which means they are much more complex, containing a decent amount of code and multiple files within one program.
