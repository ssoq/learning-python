# simple program that iterates through numbers, one at a time

number = 0

for number in range(5):
    print(number)
    number = number

# same can be done but with a variable created within the for loop too, lookie lookie

for i in range(5):
    print("Hello, how do you do?")

# tadaaaaa, just like that
