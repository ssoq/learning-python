# Learning Python

## Throughout the repository, you will find:

### Basic Programs:

These are programmed for me to learn the basics of loops, determaination statements, methods, functions, and such.

<br>

### Mini Programs

These are programmed for actual input from the users, as if it were a production ready program, though the interaction is basic, meaning the code is not all that complex.

<br>

### Large Programs

These are to act out as actual programs, which means they are much more complex, containing a decent amount of code and multiple files within one program.
